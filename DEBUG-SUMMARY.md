# Database Connection Debugging - Fixed

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Improved Error Logging**
- **Problem**: Error was showing as `[object Object]` with no useful information
- **Fix**: Added detailed error logging that shows:
  - Error message
  - Error code
  - Error details and hints
  - Context information (user ID, query parameters)

### 2. **Better Error Handling**
- **Added specific error code handling**:
  - `PGRST116`: Row not found (expected for new users)
  - `42P01`: Table doesn't exist (database not set up)
  - Generic error logging for other issues

### 3. **Database Health Check**
- **Added `checkDatabaseHealth()` function** that tests basic connectivity
- **Runs automatically on app start** to detect issues early
- **Shows status indicator** in the UI when database issues are detected

### 4. **Fallback Mechanisms**
- **Profile Creation**: If database profile fetch fails, creates fallback profile
- **Maps Component**: Falls back to static data if dynamic reports fail to load
- **Graceful Degradation**: App continues to work even with database issues

### 5. **Visual Debugging**
- **Database Status Component**: Shows connection status in bottom-right corner
- **Loading State Improvements**: Better feedback during profile loading
- **Console Logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting

## What You'll See Now

### If Database is Working:
- ‚úÖ Green "Database Connected" indicator
- ‚úÖ User profiles load correctly
- ‚úÖ Reports submission works
- ‚úÖ Activities are tracked

### If Database Needs Setup:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow warning indicator about database connection
- üìã Helpful error messages in console
- üîÑ Fallback to static/demo data
- üìù Clear instructions on what needs to be fixed

## Console Messages to Look For

### Success Messages:
```
Database health check passed
Profile fetch result: {user profile data}
Successfully fetched X reports from database
```

### Database Not Set Up:
```
Database health check failed: {error details}
Profiles table does not exist. Please run the database migration.
Reports table does not exist yet. Using static data only.
```

### Authentication Issues:
```
Error fetching profile: {detailed error with code}
Profile not found for user: {user-id}
```

## Next Steps

### If You See Database Errors:

1. **Run the Database Schema**:
   - Open Supabase dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Run the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`

2. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` is correct
   - Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON` is correct
   - Ensure they have `VITE_` prefix for client-side access

3. **Check Row Level Security**:
   - Ensure RLS policies are created correctly
   - Test with a simple query in Supabase dashboard

### If Everything is Working:
- You can dismiss the database status indicator
- All features should work as expected
- User profiles will be created automatically
- Reports will be saved to database

## Testing the Fix

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Look for the new detailed error messages** instead of `[object Object]`
3. **Check the database status indicator** in bottom-right corner
4. **Try signing up/logging in** - should see detailed logs
5. **Submit a test report** - should see success/failure logs

The app will now provide much better information about what's happening with the database connection!
