# ✅ FIXED: Database Connection Issues

## What I Fixed

### 3. **App Performance**

## 🚨 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW

**The popup appears because your Supabase database tables don't exist yet.**

### ➡️ Follow these steps:

1. **Open the file: `SUPABASE-SETUP-REQUIRED.md`**
2. **Follow ALL the steps in that file**
3. **It will take about 5-10 minutes**

### The steps are:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy/paste the SQL code into SQL Editor
3. Create 2 storage buckets (reports, avatars)
4. Set up storage policies
5. Refresh your app

## After Setup is Complete
