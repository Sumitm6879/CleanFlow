CleanFlow: Mumbai Water Bodies Revival
Project by Tanmay Nayak & Sumit Mishra
1. The Problem üåä
Mumbai, a city surrounded by water, is facing a severe ecological crisis. Its lakes, rivers (like the Mithi), and coastlines are heavily polluted by plastic waste, domestic sewage, and industrial dumping. This pollution not only endangers marine life but also poses significant health risks to the community and contributes to urban flooding during monsoons. Current solutions are often disconnected from citizen action, leading to a lack of awareness and engagement.

2. Our Solution: A Community-Led Platform ü§ù
CleanFlow is a mobile-first platform designed to empower the community to be part of the solution. Our goal is to bridge the gap between environmental issues and citizen action by creating a centralized, interactive hub for monitoring, reporting, and organizing environmental efforts.

3. Key Features ‚ú®
Our platform includes the following features to drive engagement and impact:

Interactive Map: A dynamic map of Mumbai highlighting all major water bodies. Users can see pollution hotspots and pin-point planned cleanup drives in real-time.

Crowdsourced Reporting: Anyone can easily report a polluted site by dropping a pin on the map, uploading a photo, and adding a description. This turns every citizen into a pollution watchdog.

Cleanup Drive Organization: NGOs, community groups, or individuals can create and schedule cleanup events. The map shows these events, allowing users to easily find and join local drives.

Impact Points & Leaderboard: Users earn "Impact Points" for submitting reports and participating in cleanup drives. A global leaderboard gamifies environmentalism and recognizes the most active contributors.

User Profiles & NGO Integration: Users have a personal profile to track their impact. The platform also features verified profiles for NGOs, adding credibility and visibility to their initiatives.

4. Technology Stack üíª
Our MVP was built with a modern and robust tech stack:

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, fast, and clean UI.

Backend: Supabase to manage data for reports, drives, and user profiles.

Database: Supabase

Mapping: OpenFreeMap

5. Future Vision üöÄ
If we were to continue developing this project, we would focus on:

Integrating with government or real-time sensor data for more accurate pollution visualization.

Adding a mobile app for better on-the-go reporting.

Expanding the platform to include educational resources on sustainable practices.

Creating a robust social feature to allow users to connect, form teams, and share success stories.
