# 🌊 CleanFlow Mumbai: Water Bodies Revival

**Empowering communities to restore Mumbai's water ecosystems through technology and collective action**

## 🎯 The Problem

Mumbai, despite being surrounded by water, faces a critical environmental challenge:

- 🏭 **Heavy pollution** in lakes, rivers (Mithi), and coastlines
- 🗑️ **Plastic waste and industrial dumping** contaminating water bodies

- 🌧️ **Urban flooding** during monsoons exacerbated by clogged waterways
- 👥 **Lack of citizen engagement** in environmental restoration efforts
